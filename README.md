brew install brew-cask
brew cask install java
```

### Download IntelliJ 2017.1 CE

**Don't use Android Studio!**
At least the stable version `2.3` doesn't work well with pure java/kotlin projects.
It can't download dependencies correctly and doesn't run tests.


## Use TDD

There are already a few unit tests. Don't stop there. Add more to build a solid solution.
Use TDD. Write the test, then build the solution
